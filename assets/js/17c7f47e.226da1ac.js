They mix in edge-case characters, control bytes, deep JSON structures, and integer boundary values that regular generators rarely cover.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"examples/custom-money-generator":{"id":"examples/custom-money-generator","title":"Custom Money Generator","description":"Sometimes you need domain-specific values with tailored shrinking. This example demonstrates how to write a MoneyGenerator that favours round amounts and shrinks toward $0.00.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"examples/index":{"id":"examples/index","title":"Property Testing Examples","description":"Jump into runnable property-based testing scenarios","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"examples/list-sorting-invariants":{"id":"examples/list-sorting-invariants","title":"List Sorting Invariants","description":"This quick example shows how to test a pure function with property-based techniques. We verify that our stableSort helper keeps the length of the list, preserves the elements, and is idempotent.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"examples/shelf-router-chaos-testing":{"id":"examples/shelf-router-chaos-testing","title":"Shelf Router Chaos Testing","description":"This walkthrough shows how to combine property_testing, server_testing, and server_testing_shelf to harden a Shelf API built with shelf_router. We exercise the router with randomly generated requests and ensure the service never crashes, even when hit with adversarial payloads.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"examples/stateful-counter-invariant":{"id":"examples/stateful-counter-invariant","title":"Stateful Counter Invariant","description":"Stateful properties help validate operations that evolve over time. This example checks that a simple counter never drops below zero when subjected to random increments and decrements that obey a balance constraint.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"generators":{"id":"generators","title":"Core Generators","description":"Generators are the heart of property-based testing. They produce values alongside the strategy for shrinking them toward simpler counterexamples. Every generator implements Generator and returns a ShrinkableValue from generate(Random random).","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"getting-started":{"id":"getting-started","title":"Getting Started","description":"Install","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Property Testing Home","description":"Navigate property-based testing topics in the recommended order","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Property Testing Overview","description":"Property-based testing lets you validate general behaviours rather than hand-picked example cases. The property_testing package is inspired by tools such as Hypothesis and ScalaCheck and brings the approach to Dart with first-class shrinking, rich generators, and stateful scenarios.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"runner-and-reporting":{"id":"runner-and-reporting","title":"Running & Reporting","description":"The runner orchestrates value generation, property execution, shrinking, and reporting. Understanding its knobs helps you tune performance and diagnostics for different scenarios.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"specialized-generators":{"id":"specialized-generators","title":"Specialized Generators","description":"Specialized packages up higher-level data types that would otherwise take time to craft by hand. They expose expressive options and tuned shrinking strategies.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"},"stateful-testing":{"id":"stateful-testing","title":"Stateful Testing","description":"Property-based testing shines when you verify behaviours across sequences of operations. The stateful module models your system under test (SUT) with Command objects and compares it against an expected Model.","sidebar":"propertyTestingSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
