# Localization Example

Runnable sample that exercises Routed's localization provider, locale resolver
registry, and translation files under `resources/lang`.

```bash
dart pub get
dart run bin/server.dart
```

Look at the config files in `config/translation.yaml` and the resources folder
for guidance when enabling localization in your own project.
