# Forward Proxy Example

Implements a simple forward proxy using Routed's middleware + request context.
Great for testing header re-writing, upstream timeouts, and logging hooks.

```bash
dart pub get
dart run bin/server.dart --config config/proxy.yaml
```

Part of the routed_ecosystem examples—not published to pub.dev.
