# Config Demo

Demo server that showcases Routed's configuration manifests and provider docs.
It lives inside the workspace so you can run it locally while editing config
files or testing new CLI workflows.

```bash
dart pub get
dart run bin/server.dart
```

This package is not published to pub.dev; it's here purely for hands-on demos.
