# Project Commands Demo

Companion example for `routed_cli project` / `commands` workflows. It ships
with custom commands under `lib/commands.dart` so you can see how the CLI loads
user-defined tasks.

```bash
dart pub get
dart run routed project:list
```

Great starting point for building your own CLI command packs.
