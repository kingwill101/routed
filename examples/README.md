| [Engine Configuration](untitled1/examples/engine_config_example) | Shows how to configure the engine with options like trailing slash redirect, method not allowed handling, and IP forwarding. |
| [Engine Default Router](untitled1/examples/engine_default_router_example) | Demonstrates how to register routes directly on the engine and apply middleware. |
| [Engine Route](untitled1/examples/engine_route_example) | Shows how to define routes with various parameter types like integer, double, slug, UUID, email, IP, and string. |

| [Multipart](untitled1/examples/multipart) | Shows how to handle multipart form data including file uploads. |
| [Query Parameters](untitled1/examples/query_parameter_example) | Demonstrates how to handle query parameters and validate them. |
| [Route Matching](untitled1/examples/route_matching_example) | Shows how to define routes for different HTTP methods and handle path parameters. |
