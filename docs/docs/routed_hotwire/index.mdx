# Routed Hotwire

Routed Hotwire brings Turbo Streams, Turbo Frames, and Stimulus helpers into the Routed ecosystem so you can build interactive hybrid applications without leaving Dart.

## Features

- Turbo Stream response helpers for append, replace, and remove operations.
- Turbo Frame helpers for incremental updates.
- Stimulus controller scaffolds and asset registration middleware.
- Test utilities built on top of `routed_testing` and `server_testing`.

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  routed_hotwire: ^0.1.0
```

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:routed_hotwire/routed_hotwire.dart';

router.post('/notes', (ctx) async {
  final note = await notes.create(ctx.input('content'));
  return turboStream((streams) {
    streams.append('#notes', renderNote(note));
  });
});
```

## Next steps

- Review the Turbo helpers in the `example/` directory.
- Pair Hotwire responses with Routed templates under `view.directory`.
