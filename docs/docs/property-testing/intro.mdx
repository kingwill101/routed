title: Property Testing Overview
sidebar_position: 1

Property-based testing lets you validate general behaviours rather than hand-picked example cases. The `property_testing` package is inspired by tools such as Hypothesis and ScalaCheck and brings the approach to Dart with first-class shrinking, rich generators, and stateful scenarios.

- Generate thousands of structured inputs automatically and shrink failures to the minimal counterexample.
- Compose generators functionally with `map`, `flatMap`, `where`, `list`, `oneOf`, `frequency`, and container helpers.
- Reach for batteries-included primitives plus specialised data such as `Uri`, `DateTime`, semantic versions, emails, and RGBA colours.
- Hunt for edge cases with the Chaos suite that targets SQL injection, path traversal, control characters, oversized payloads, and more.
- Model long-running workflows with state machine tests built from `Command` objects and sequence generators.
- Capture actionable reports and aggregate statistics to guide debugging in CI.

### Package layout

| Area | APIs | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generators | `Generator<T>`, `ShrinkableValue`, `Gen` | Build reusable input factories with shrinking. |
| Specialised data | `Specialized.*` | Generate higher-level values such as URIs or semantic versions. |
| Chaos testing | `Chaos.*`, `ChaosConfig`, `ChaosCategory` | Stress endpoints, parsers, and validators with adversarial inputs. |
| Runner & config | `PropertyTestRunner`, `PropertyConfig`, `PropertyResult` | Execute property functions and tune execution. |
| Reporting | `PropertyTestReporter`, `PropertyResultExtensions`, `TestStatisticsCollector` | Render human-readable failure reports and aggregate multiple runs. |
| Stateful testing | `Command`, `CommandSequence`, `StatefulPropertyBuilder`, `StatefulPropertyRunner` | Exercise systems over histories of operations and invariants. |

Everything is exported through `package:property_testing/property_testing.dart`.

### A taste of property-based testing

```dart
import 'package:property_testing/property_testing.dart';
import 'package:test/test.dart';

void main() {
  test('list reversal is an involution', () async {
    final runner = PropertyTestRunner(
      Gen.integer(min: -1000, max: 1000).list(maxLength: 50),
      (values) {
        expect(values.reversed.toList().reversed.toList(), equals(values));
      },
      PropertyConfig(numTests: 500, seed: 1337),
    );

    final result = await runner.run();
    expect(result.success, isTrue, reason: result.report);
  });
}
```

The rest of this guide dives into each part of the API and shows how to combine them effectively in real projects.
