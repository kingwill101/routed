## Install

Add the package to your `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  property_testing: ^0.1.0
  test: ^1.25.0
```

Then import everything from the umbrella library:

```dart
import 'package:property_testing/property_testing.dart';
```

## Your first property

Wrap the runner inside a `package:test` case so failures get reported like any other test:

```dart
test('addition is commutative', () async {
  final runner = PropertyTestRunner(
    Gen.integer().list(minLength: 2, maxLength: 2),
    (pair) {
      expect(pair[0] + pair[1], equals(pair[1] + pair[0]));
    },
    PropertyConfig(
      numTests: 400, // more coverage than a hand-written handful
      seed: 20240115, // keep failing seeds to reproduce
    ),
  );

  final result = await runner.run();
  expect(result.success, isTrue, reason: result.report);
});
```

`PropertyTestRunner` executes the property `numTests` times, shrinking any failure before returning a `PropertyResult`. Passing the `report` into `expect` ensures the minimal counterexample, error, and stack trace are printed if the property breaks.

## Asynchronous properties and timeouts

The runner accepts property functions that return `Future<void>`—ideal for exercising HTTP handlers, database calls, or any async logic. Use `PropertyConfig.timeout` to guard long-running cases:

```dart
test('API never returns 5xx for valid payloads', () async {
  final runner = PropertyTestRunner(
    Gen.string(maxLength: 128),
    (payload) async {
      final response = await client.post('/api/data', body: payload);
      expect(response.statusCode, lessThan(500));
    },
    PropertyConfig(
      numTests: 250,
      timeout: const Duration(seconds: 2), // per-case timeout
    ),
  );

  final result = await runner.run();
  expect(result.success, isTrue, reason: result.report);
});
```

If a single invocation exceeds the timeout or throws, the runner captures the error, shrinks the input, and returns immediately with the failing example.

## Re-running a failing seed

When a property fails, note the reported seed to reproduce the sequence:

```txt
✗ Property test failed
  Failed after 37 test cases
  Seed: 20240115
  ...
```

Reuse that seed in the `PropertyConfig` to replay the same inputs while you debug. If you supply your own `Random` instance via `PropertyConfig(random: Random(...))`, you are responsible for preserving it to reproduce the run.

## When to stop shrinking?

The default `maxShrinks` (100) works well for most use-cases. Increase it if you have deeply nested structures or long command sequences, or decrease it to speed up debugging when the full shrinking search is too costly.
