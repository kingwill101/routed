# Examples

Copy these walkthroughs into your test suite to see property testing concepts in action:

- [List sorting invariants](/docs/property_testing/examples/list-sorting-invariants) — verify sorting behaves correctly across large input spaces.
- [Stateful counter invariant](/docs/property_testing/examples/stateful-counter-invariant) — model a state machine and assert invariants over sequences.
- [Custom money generator](/docs/property_testing/examples/custom-money-generator) — build domain-specific generators with shrinking.
- [Shelf router chaos testing](/docs/property_testing/examples/shelf-router-chaos-testing) — stress endpoints with the Chaos suite.

> Each example includes the imports required; paste them into a `test/` file and run with `dart test`.
