# Routed Testing

`routed_testing` provides convenience wrappers that plug `server_testing` into Routed engines. It ships helpers like `engineTest` and prebuilt handler providers so you can focus on test logic instead of wiring.

## Install

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  routed_testing: ^0.2.0
```

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:routed/routed.dart';
import 'package:routed_testing/routed_testing.dart';

engineTest('GET /health', (engine, client) async {
  engine.get('/health', (ctx) => ctx.string('ok'));
  final res = await client.get('/health');
  res.assertStatus(200).assertBody('ok');
});
```
