# Server Testing

Welcome! This hub helps you move through `server_testing` topics in a logical orderâ€”from setup, to HTTP workflows, to browser automation, and detailed reference material.

## Start Here
- [Overview](/docs/server-testing/intro) â€” understand the capabilities and ecosystem packages.
- [Getting Started](/docs/server-testing/getting-started) â€” add dependencies, wire a handler provider, and run your first `serverTest`.

## Core Workflow
- [Test Transports](/docs/server-testing/transports) â€” choose between in-memory and ephemeral server modes.
- [HTTP Testing](/docs/server-testing/http-testing) â€” structure end-to-end API tests with fluent assertions.
- [Handler Providers](/docs/server-testing/handler-providers) â€” adapt any framework by implementing `RequestHandler`.
- [Example Gallery](/docs/server-testing/examples/) â€” browse server-side and browser automation scenarios.

## Tooling & Automation
- [CLI](/docs/server-testing/cli) â€” install browser bundles, drivers, and scaffold test suites.
- [Browser Testing](/docs/server-testing/browser/browser-testing) â€” drive WebDriver sessions with shared handlers.
- [BrowserConfig & Devices](/docs/server-testing/browser/browser-config) â€” tune headless/headed runs, logging, and device emulation.
- [Pages & Components](/docs/server-testing/browser/pages-and-components) â€” model UI flows with reusable page objects.

## Reference Library
- [Test Client](/docs/server-testing/test-client) â€” construct clients, send requests, and manage transports.
- [Test Response](/docs/server-testing/test-client/test-response) â€” chain fluent assertions across status, headers, and JSON bodies.
- [Assertion Deep Dives](/docs/server-testing/test-client/response-assertions) â€” expand into [headers](/docs/server-testing/test-client/headers), [JSON](/docs/server-testing/test-client/json-assertions), [schema validation](/docs/server-testing/test-client/schema-validation), and [numeric helpers](/docs/server-testing/test-client/numeric-assertions).
