# Force reinstall & cache

- BrowserConfig.forceReinstall triggers re-download for browsers and drivers during bootstrap/launch.
- The registry uses an installation lock to avoid races when multiple tests download the same browser.
- On force reinstall, the existing directory is removed and re-created; drivers are deleted then fetched again.

When to use

- Corrupted caches, switching to a different revision/channel, or CI cold-start scenarios.

Parallel safety

- Locks serialize installation; multiple parallel test processes wonâ€™t corrupt the cache.
- For best results in CI, pre-warm the cache in a dedicated job.
