# Screenshots & logs

- Default directory: test_screenshots. Override with BrowserConfig.screenshotDirectory.
- Filenames include ISO timestamps to avoid collisions; you can pass a custom base name.
- PNG validation: the test suite checks for the PNG signature and non-zero size to detect corruption.
- Auto screenshots: enable BrowserConfig.autoScreenshots to capture on failures.
- Store both screenshots and logs as CI artifacts for failed runs.
