# Installation & CI

## Version pinning

- server_testing uses an internal registry (browsers.json) that maps platform -> revision.
- You can pin a specific channel via BrowserConfig.browserName (e.g., chromium, firefox) and set forceReinstall for clean rebuilds.
- Drivers are managed automatically per browser type.

## OS dependencies

- Linux: ensure common X/GL libraries and fonts are installed. Headless runs still need libX11 and font packages.
- macOS: no extra deps for headless; permissions may prompt when running headed for the first time.
- Windows: no exec-bit concerns; ensure .exe binaries are accessible.

## Permissions

- On Linux/macOS, executables are chmod +x after extraction. If using a custom directory, ensure your user can write and execute.

## CI

- Prefer headless. Configure BrowserConfig(headless: true) and autoInstall: true.
- Cache the registry directory to speed up builds. Default cache: ~/.server_testing (override with SERVER_TESTING_CACHE_DIR)
- Artifacts: store test_screenshots/ and logs for debugging failures.
