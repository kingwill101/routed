# CLI

The `server_testing` CLI ships with the package and helps prepare the local environment for browser automation. Run commands with:

```bash
dart run server_testing <command> [args]
```

## Install Browser Bundles

Download and cache Playwright-style browser builds referenced by `browsers.json`. By default the command installs the browsers flagged with `"installByDefault": true`.

```bash
dart run server_testing install               # install defaults (e.g. firefox)
dart run server_testing install chromium      # explicit target
dart run server_testing install chromium -f   # force re-download
dart run server_testing install firefox --force
```

Bundles are stored under `~/.cache/server_testing` (or the platform-specific equivalent).

## Install Driver Servers

Ensure the matching WebDriver binary (e.g. GeckoDriver, ChromeDriver) is present and ready to launch.

```bash
dart run server_testing install:driver firefox
dart run server_testing install:driver chrome --force
```

The command downloads the driver and starts it on demand at runtime; forcing a reinstall removes the cached binary first.

## Bootstrap a Project

`init` sets up a conventional folder layout and example tests:

```bash
dart run server_testing init
```

This command:
- Creates `test/http/` and `test/browser/` directories (if missing)
- Writes sample HTTP and browser test files
- Generates a minimal `browsers.json`

## Generate Test Files

Create new stubs that follow the recommended structure:

```bash
dart run server_testing create:http users_api
dart run server_testing create:browser home_page
```

Both commands write a `<name>_test.dart` inside the appropriate directory. Use these as a starting point for larger suites.

## CI Tips
- Cache `~/.cache/server_testing` (browser bundles) and your driver directory between runs to avoid repeated downloads.
- Install browsers and drivers during the build step (`dart run server_testing install` and `install:driver`) so test jobs can start immediately.
- If running in a container with limited permissions, point the cache directories to a writable location via environment variables before calling the CLI.
