# Routed Ecosystem Documentation

Welcome! These docs cover the larger Routed ecosystem—core routing, server-side testing, property-based utilities, and tutorials. Start with the area that matches your goals:

## Core Libraries
- [Routed](/docs/routed/) — routers, controllers, view models, and ecosystem add-ons.
- [Server Testing](/docs/server-testing/) — HTTP and browser automation with reusable handler adapters.
- [Property Testing](/docs/property-testing/) — property-based testing primitives, stateful testing, and chaos suites.

## Shared Tooling
- Assertions and JSON helpers are exposed via `assertable_json` (see [response assertions](/docs/server-testing/test-client/response-assertions)).
- Tutorials live under [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/routed-rest-api) for end-to-end walkthroughs.

> Looking for a quick start? Jump directly to the [Server Testing Getting Started](/docs/server-testing/getting-started) or [Property Testing Getting Started](/docs/property-testing/getting-started) guides.
