# Routed Ecosystem Documentation

Welcome! These docs cover the larger Routed ecosystem—core routing, Hotwire helpers, server-side testing, property-based utilities, and tutorials. Start with the area that matches your goals:

## Core Libraries
- [Routed](/docs/routed/) — routers, controllers, view models, and ecosystem add-ons.
- [Routed Hotwire](/docs/routed_hotwire/) — Turbo Streams and Stimulus helpers for interactive UIs.
- [Server Testing](/docs/server_testing/) — HTTP and browser automation with reusable handler adapters.
- [Server Testing Shelf](/docs/server_testing_shelf/) — Shelf request handler adapter for server_testing.
- [Routed Testing](/docs/routed_testing/) — Routed-first testing helpers built on server_testing.
- [Property Testing](/docs/property_testing/) — property-based testing primitives, stateful testing, and chaos suites.

## Shared Tooling
- Tutorials live under [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/routed-rest-api) for end-to-end walkthroughs.
