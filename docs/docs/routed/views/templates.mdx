# Liquid Templates

Routed bundles a Liquid view engine so you can keep HTML in template files, pass data from handlers, and swap engines or directories without changing route code. If `view.engine` is omitted or unrecognised, Routed falls back to Liquid.

## Configuration

Describe your template location through `storage.*` and `view.*` so the view provider shares disks with the rest of the application:

```yaml title="config/http.yaml"
storage:
  default: app
  disks:
    app:
      driver: local
      root: resources

view:
  engine: liquid
  disk: app
  directory: views
  cache: true
```

Or provide the same structure when instantiating the engine:

```dart
final engine = Engine(
  configItems: {
    'storage': {
      'default': 'app',
      'disks': {
        'app': {'driver': 'local', 'root': 'resources'},
      },
    },
    'view': {
      'engine': 'liquid',
      'disk': 'app',
      'directory': 'views',
      'cache': true,
    },
  },
);
await engine.initialize();
```

The `directory` is resolved relative to the selected disk (set it to an empty string to render from the disk root). The default directory is `views`, but some templates (including the web scaffold) set it to `templates`. During development set `view.cache: false` to reload templates on each request; in production prefer `true` for performance. When both a disk and directory are configured, template lookups resolve to `<disk root>/<directory>`. To swap engines or point Liquid at a different file system at runtime—without changing route code—call `engine.useViewEngine`:

```dart
engine.useViewEngine(
  LiquidViewEngine(
    root: LiquidRoot(fileSystem: myFileSystem),
    directory: 'emails',
  ),
);
```

Place templates under the configured directory (`resources/views/` in this example). When a disk is used the engine reads through the same file abstraction that powers static assets, uploads, and other providers.
Import `package:routed/template.dart` whenever you reference `LiquidViewEngine` or `LiquidRoot`.

> Validation: The view provider ensures `view` configuration is a map, verifies that `engine`, `directory`, and `disk` are non-empty strings (and that `cache` is a boolean), then throws a `ProviderConfigException` if the manifest supplies the wrong shape. `dart run routed provider:list --config` is a quick way to confirm the active settings and catch mistakes before the engine starts.

## Rendering templates

```dart
router.get('/welcome', (ctx) async {
  return await ctx.template(
    templateName: 'welcome.liquid',
    data: {
      'user': {'name': 'Taylor'},
      'features': ['sessions', 'cache', 'validation'],
    },
  );
});
```

Liquid templates support the familiar syntax. Values are HTML-escaped by default; use filters (for example, | raw) only when you trust the content:

```liquid
<!-- views/welcome.liquid -->
<h1>Hello {{ user.name }}!</h1>
<ul>
  {% for feature in features %}
    <li>{{ feature }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

## Inline HTML fragments

Use `ctx.html` to render a snippet through the view engine (useful for partials or emails). It supports the same template syntax as files; prefer `ctx.template` for full pages and `ctx.string` for literal HTML without templating:

```dart
await ctx.html('<p>{{ message }}</p>', data: {'message': 'Success!'});
```

## View extension registry

Providers can register view extensions without coupling to a specific engine
API. The registry stores engine-specific callbacks and applies them during
rendering, so you can register filters or tags lazily and still see them on
subsequent renders.

```dart title="Register Liquid extensions"
import 'package:liquify/liquify.dart' as liquid;
import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

ViewExtensionRegistry.instance.registerFor('liquid', (target) {
  final env = target as liquid.Environment;
  env.registerLocalFilter('markdown', (value, args, named) {
    return renderMarkdown(value.toString());
  });
  env.registerLocalTag('asset', (content, filters) {
    return AssetTag(content, filters);
  });
});
```

Each view engine defines its own extension surface. Use the correct engine name
(`liquid`, `mustache`, etc.) and cast the `target` to the engine-specific type
inside the callback.

To customise Liquid more deeply, extend `LiquidViewEngine` and integrate with
the underlying `liquify` APIs before registering the engine with the `Engine`.

## Error handling

If a template is missing or renders with an error, a `TemplateRenderException` is thrown. You can catch it inside your handler to return a custom error page:

```dart
router.get('/report', (ctx) async {
  try {
    return await ctx.template(templateName: 'report.liquid');
  } on TemplateRenderException catch (e) {
    return ctx.json({'error': e.toString()}, statusCode: HttpStatus.internalServerError);
  }
});
```

Import `dart:io` to access `HttpStatus` constants when needed.

## Custom engines

`ViewEngine` is an interface, so you can plug in any renderer you like (`packages/routed/lib/src/view/view_engine.dart:1`). Swap the default engine with your own implementation:

```dart
class MarkdownViewEngine implements ViewEngine {
  @override
  List<String> get extensions => ['.md', '.mdx'];

  @override
  Future<String> render(String name, [Map<String, dynamic>? data]) async {
    final template = await loadTemplate(name);
    return renderMarkdown(template, data ?? {});
  }

  @override
  Future<String> renderFile(String filePath, [Map<String, dynamic>? data]) async {
    final source = await File(filePath).readAsString();
    return renderMarkdown(source, data ?? {});
  }
}

final engine = Engine();
engine.useViewEngine(MarkdownViewEngine(), directory: 'content');
```

For projects that need more than one templating language, grab the shared `ViewEngineManager` and register additional engines by extension (`packages/routed/lib/src/view/engine_manager.dart:1`):

```dart
final manager = engine.container.get<ViewEngineManager>();
manager.register(MarkdownViewEngine());
```

After registration you can call `ctx.template(templateName: 'guide.md')` and Routed will route the request to the matching engine based on file extension. Mix and match engines by registering each with the manager before serving requests.

### View engine manager

`ViewEngineManager` routes `render` and `renderFile` calls based on the file extension of the template name. If no engine matches the extension, it throws an exception immediately so you can catch misconfigured template names during development.
