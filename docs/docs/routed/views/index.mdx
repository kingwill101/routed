# Views & Templates

Routed exposes a pluggable view engine API. The built-in Liquid engine lets you render HTML templates with familiar syntax, while the `ViewEngine` interface allows you to integrate other template renderers.

- [Liquid templates](/docs/routed/views/templates) – configure the engine, render views, and pass data to templates.
- [Custom engines](/docs/routed/views/templates#custom-engines) – implement `ViewEngine` or register additional engines with `ViewEngineManager`.

The view provider reads its settings from the `view.*` namespace and shares storage disks with the rest of the ecosystem. Define disks once under `storage.*`, point `view.disk` (optional) at the disk you want to use, and the provider resolves paths through the shared `StorageManager`. Run `dart run routed_cli provider:list --config` to inspect active providers, view defaults, and catch invalid overrides (`ProviderConfigException`) before booting the engine.
