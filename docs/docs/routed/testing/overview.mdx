# Testing Routed Applications

Routed integrates tightly with the `server_testing` ecosystem. The `routed_testing` package wraps an `Engine` in a `RequestHandler` so you can write fluent HTTP assertions with minimal boilerplate, using either an in-memory transport or an ephemeral HTTP server when needed.

## Recommended stack

- **`server_testing`** – transport-agnostic HTTP client, JSON assertions, and browser automation.
- **`routed_testing`** – helpers (`engineTest`, `engineGroup`, `RoutedRequestHandler`) that wire a Routed engine into `server_testing`.
- **`property_testing`** *(optional)* – generate inputs and run stateful properties against your routes.

Install as dev dependencies:

```bash
dart pub add --dev server_testing server_testing_shelf routed_testing
```

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:routed/routed.dart';
import 'package:routed_testing/routed_testing.dart';
import 'package:server_testing/server_testing.dart';

void main() {
  engineTest('GET /ping returns 200', (engine, client) async {
    engine.get('/ping', (ctx) => ctx.json({'ok': true}));

    final res = await client.getJson('/ping');
    res
      ..assertStatus(200)
      ..assertJson((json) => json.where('ok', true));
  });
}
```

See [Getting Started](/docs/routed/testing/getting-started) for a walkthrough, or jump to [engineGroup](/docs/routed/testing/engine-group) to share setup across multiple tests and choose between in-memory or ephemeral-server transports.
