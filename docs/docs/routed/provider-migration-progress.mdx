## Snapshot

- **Last updated:** October 22, 2025
- **Owner:** Routing bootstrap workstream
- **Context:** Continuing the move from `EngineConfig` flags to provider-driven defaults, manifests, and middleware stacks.

## Summary

- Engine bootstrap now returns a fully initialized instance, allowing immediate event hook registration and provider toggles (via `includeDefaultProviders`).
- Routing lifecycle events (`BeforeRouting`, `RouteMatched`, `RouteNotFound`, `RoutingError`, `AfterRouting`) emit for every request with full context.
- Routing defaults (`redirectTrailingSlash`, `handleMethodNotAllowed`) now live under `routing.*`; the routing provider applies them on boot/reload via `ConfigReloadedEvent` instead of mutating `EngineConfig`.
- Providers can advertise defaults with `ProvidesDefaultConfig`; `ConfigRegistry` aggregates them and `ConfigImpl.mergeDefaults` avoids clobbering user overrides.
- Provider teardown guards optional dependencies (e.g., `EventManager`) so cleanup succeeds even after containers dispose.
- Upload limits (`max_memory`, `max_file_size`, `allowed_extensions`, directory/permissions) are sourced from `uploads.*`; the uploads provider normalizes legacy paths, reapplies limits on reload, and `withMultipart` now mutates config instead of the engine instance.
- CORS settings (`enabled`, origins, methods, headers, credentials, cache) now resolve from `cors.*` (with legacy fallbacks) via the CORS provider, and the new `withCors` EngineOpt writes through config for reload-safe updates.
- Cache manager configuration (default store, store definitions) now flows through `cache.*`; the cache provider rebuilds managed stores on config reload while honoring pre-bound `withCacheManager` overrides.
- Static assets can be described via `static.*` (enabled flag, mounts with route/directory/index/listing). The static provider short-circuits requests through a middleware, translating legacy `http.features.static` keys during reloads.
- Logging toggles (`logging.enabled`, `logging.level`, `logging.errors_only`) now live under the logging provider; `withLogging` updates config and the middleware responds to config reloads without restarting the engine.
- Storage and view providers now share `storage.*` disks; view directories resolve through `StorageManager`, keeping templates aligned with the shared file system layer. Static, storage, and view providers all reuse the shared parsing helpers, so disks can be declared once and referenced safely via `static.mounts[].disk` or `view.disk`.
- Security, uploads, CORS, view, cache, logging, static, and storage providers now validate config inputs and throw `ProviderConfigException` when the manifest supplies the wrong shape (e.g., non-boolean CSRF flags, malformed trusted proxy headers, non-string view directories). The shared config utilities make that validation consistent across providers.
- Provider registry coverage is complete for defaults referenced in `config/http.yaml`; example/custom providers register themselves (and publish defaults via `ProvidesDefaultConfig`) so `provider:list --config` can surface accurate descriptions.
- Config loader pre-processes YAML/JSON/TOML via Liquify, exposing `.env` + process environment values (including double-underscore nested keys) to config templates with `{{ }}` placeholders. Every key is mirrored under `env.*` (`APP_KEY` â†’ `{{ env.APP_KEY }}`), and double underscores add a dotted alias alongside the original.
- Provider CLI (`provider:list`, `provider:enable`, `provider:disable`) now surfaces validation-friendly defaults and warns when manifests reference unregistered providers; documentation points to the new fail-fast behaviour.
- Session cookies are now URI-encoded and decoded, keeping values parser-friendly across transports while remaining backward compatible.
- Middleware stack rebuilds push consolidated IDs back into `http.middleware.*`, ensuring both the engine and config consumers observe manifest-derived defaults; regression tests cover deduplication and order guarantees.
- Middleware registry supports `MiddlewareRef.of('id')` references; routes/groups/mounts can refer to middleware by name and the engine resolves them against the registry during route build with clear errors for missing IDs.
- Logging provider now honours `logging.extra_fields` and `logging.request_headers`, letting apps enrich structured payloads without custom middleware.
- Static asset mounts accept a custom `file_system` + `root`, enabling memory-backed fixtures or virtual file systems without manual handler wiring.
- `routed_cli` ships configuration tooling (`config:init`, `config:publish`, `config:cache`, `config:clear`) plus runnable examples (`config_demo`, `route_events`) and updated docs.
- The `config_demo` example now relies on `config/http.yaml` and the manifest/registry flow instead of manual provider registration.
- Regression tests now cover session flows across in-memory and ephemeral transports, assert manifest-driven middleware ordering/deduplication, verify routing/uploads config sourcing, and assert provider validation errors for security/uploads/cors/cache/view/storage/mail overrides.
- Removed the pre-routing middleware stage; global middlewares now handle preflight requests (including CORS) directly.
- Security provider now resolves trusted proxies via config and injects a pre-routing middleware that normalizes client IPs.
- Sessions now resolve from `Config` (e.g., `session.config`/`session` maps) and the cache manager is provisioned entirely via the cache provider defaults instead of `EngineConfig` fields.
- Provider registry, manifest loading, and middleware stack rebuilding are wired, and initial CLI provider commands are available.

## In Progress

- Fold the new validation guards into docs/tutorials and cross-link CLI guidance.
- Backfill helper APIs (`engineTest`, `engineGroup`, provider fixtures) with manifest-aware helpers now that validation is stricter.

## Outstanding Work

<Tabs groupId="outstanding-scope">
<TabItem value="providers" label="Provider Modules">

- Ship remaining advanced knobs (structured logging formatters, static asset virtual file systems) behind provider config with matching defaults.
- Audit secondary modules (websocket, websocket session helpers, timeout middleware) for validation gaps and add `ProviderConfigException` coverage where needed.
- Continue documenting provider defaults/registry expectations so package authors publish `ProvidesDefaultConfig` entries out of the gate.
- Maintain a compatibility layer that translates legacy `EngineConfig` flags into new provider defaults until the next major release.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="middleware" label="Middleware Stacks">

- Finalize the manifest format to declare middleware stacks and groups, similar to Laravel's kernel configuration.
- Guarantee provider contributions merge without duplicating entries and preserve execution order.
- Document the middleware stack expectations and how providers extend them.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI & Tooling">

- Add machine-readable output (JSON/summary) for `provider:list` so CI can audit manifests automatically.
- Surface validation hints or config paths when `provider:list --config` encounters malformed overrides (mirror runtime errors).
- Harden project root detection to support temporary directories without side effects.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Testing Status

- **Passing locally:** `dart test packages/routed`, `dart test packages/routed_cli`, targeted suites for sessions, engine bootstrap, and provider validation.
- **New coverage:** provider validation suites for security/uploads/cors/cache/view/storage modules, config-demo mail provider adoption tests, and refreshed middleware manifest regression coverage (dedup/order, logging extras, static mounts).
- **Planned additions:** extend CLI tests for `provider:list --config` (including machine-readable output) and land integration harnesses that assert manifest-derived middleware ordering under provider validation failures.

## Risks & Notes

- Middleware globals can go empty if defaults are not merged prior to stack rebuild; verify contributions before applying them (dedicated tests still pending).
- Built-in behaviors (CORS, CSRF, etc.) must migrate cleanly into providers without changing defaults.
- Watch for trusted proxy warnings in tests once configuration defaults move; adjust fixtures accordingly.

## Next Steps

1. Deliver the remaining advanced configuration surfaces (structured logging formatters, static asset virtual file systems) via provider defaults and expose them through the CLI manifest.
2. Update documentation and tutorials to highlight the new provider validation errors, registry expectations, and CLI inspection workflows.
3. Extend automated coverage: manifest-order integration tests, CLI machine-readable snapshots, and provider validation failure cases across less-common modules (websocket/timeouts).
