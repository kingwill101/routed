# Routed Overview

Routed is a modular HTTP framework for Dart applications. It combines a lightweight engine, a composable router, first-class middleware, view rendering, caching, sessions, and tight integration with the testing packages in this repository.

## Core Pieces

- **Engine** – bootstraps service providers, mounts routers, hosts global middleware, and serves HTTP/WebSocket requests.
- **Router** – builds hierarchical route trees with parameter constraints, route naming, fallback handlers, and static file support.
- **Context APIs** – expose rich request/response helpers, validation, headers, cookies, and cache/session utilities from within handlers.
- **View rendering** – render Liquid templates out of the box and plug in custom template engines.
- **Stateful utilities** – optional cache manager, session middleware, and request-ID helpers.
- **[Signals & events](/docs/routed/advanced/signals)** – a typed signal hub backed by the event bus so you can hook into request lifecycle changes without manual stream management.
- **Security & runtime** – built-in CSRF, CORS, security headers, request size limits, trusted proxy support, HTTP/2 negotiation, response compression, and graceful shutdown controls via `EngineConfig`.
- **Providers & manifest** – each subsystem (cache, sessions, uploads, static assets, security, logging, etc.) ships as a service provider with sensible defaults. The manifest (`config/http.yaml`) controls which providers are active, and the CLI (`dart run routed_cli provider:list --config`) shows active providers, merged defaults, and any validation errors.
- **CLI tooling** – `routed_cli` scaffolds projects, runs a hot-reload dev server, inspects routes, and generates persisted specs.

## Quick Start

```dart
import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final engine = Engine(
    middlewares: [
      loggingMiddleware(),
      timeoutMiddleware(const Duration(seconds: 30)),
    ],
  );

  engine.get('/hello/{name}', (ctx) async {
    final name = ctx.mustGetParam<String>('name');
    return ctx.json({'message': 'Hello $name'});
  }).name('hello.show');

  engine.group(
    path: '/api',
    middlewares: [requireAuthenticated()],
    builder: (router) {
      router.post('/orders', createOrder);
      router.get('/orders/{id:int}', showOrder);
    },
  );

  await engine.serve(port: 8080);
}
```

This example highlights the core workflow:

1. Build an `Engine` with global middleware (logging, timeouts, etc.).
2. Register routes with typed parameters and route names for URL generation.
3. Group related routes, layering authentication middleware without repeating configuration.
4. Start the server with HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, static assets, sessions, and observability features ready to enable as needs evolve.

## Where to Start

- [Getting Started](/docs/routed/getting-started): install packages, create an engine, mount a router, and run your first server.
- [Fundamentals](/docs/routed/fundamentals/): routing, middleware, request and response helpers, validation, CLI tooling, and configuration.
- [State & Persistence](/docs/routed/state/): caching and session management using configurable stores.
- [Security](/docs/routed/security): enable CSRF, CORS, proxy awareness, secure headers, upload hardening, and tune compression.
- [Server-Sent Events](/docs/routed/fundamentals/sse): stream real-time updates with the built-in SSE helper and heartbeats.
- [Graceful shutdown](/docs/routed/fundamentals/graceful-shutdown): configure signal handlers and draining behaviour.
- [Views & Templating](/docs/routed/views/): render Liquid views and integrate custom template engines.
- [Testing](/docs/routed/testing/overview): test Routed applications with `routed_testing` and `server_testing`.
- [Examples](/docs/routed/examples/): copy-ready snippets for APIs, sessions, and templated responses.

## Ecosystem Packages

| Package | Purpose |
