# State & Persistence

Routed provides caching and session capabilities that integrate directly with `EngineContext`.

- [Caching](/docs/routed/state/caching) – register stores, cache values, increment counters, and use remember/rememberForever helpers.
- [Sessions](/docs/routed/state/sessions) – configure cookie- or file-backed sessions, then read and write session data in handlers.

Both features are optional and provider-driven. Enable them imperatively via `EngineConfig` or functional options (`withCacheManager`, `withSessionConfig`), or declaratively by keeping the default providers (`routed.cache`, `routed.sessions`) enabled in your manifest. Providers validate configuration at boot—malformed overrides surface as `ProviderConfigException` so you can fix them early. Run `dart run routed provider:list --config` to review active providers and their merged defaults.
