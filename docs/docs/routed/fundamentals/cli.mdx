# Routed CLI Reference

The `routed_cli` package ships project scaffolding, a hot-reload dev server, route/spec inspection utilities, and manifest helpers. Install it beside your application (recommended) or activate it globally:

```bash
dart pub add --dev routed_cli
# or: dart pub global activate routed_cli
```

Run commands with `dart run routed_cli <command> [...]`. Add `--verbose` to surface extra debug output.

> **Choosing a Dart executable:** The CLI honours the first set environment variable in `ROUTED_CLI_DART`, `DART_BIN`, or `DART_PATH`. Set one of these when you manage multiple SDKs (for example, with FVM) so every command launches the intended runtime.

## `create`

```bash
dart run routed_cli create --name my_app [--output <dir>] [--force]
```

Scaffolds a Routed project, writing `bin/server.dart`, config manifests, README, `.env`, analysis options, and storage directories. Options:

- `--name/-n` – project & package name (required when scaffolding into the current directory).
- `--output/-o` – destination directory (defaults to `.`).
- `--template/-t` – template to use (`basic`, `api`, `web`, or `fullstack`).
- `--force/-f` – overwrite conflicting files.

After generating files, `create` automatically runs `dart pub get` using the resolved Dart executable. If dependency resolution fails the CLI prints the exit code and keeps the “Next steps” list so you can retry manually.

## `dev`

```bash
dart run routed_cli dev [--entry bin/server.dart] [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 8080]
```

Launches a development server with hot-reload support. Highlights:

- Resolves the correct Dart binary (respecting the environment overrides above) and enables the VM service.
- Generates a bootstrap that wires in [`hotreloader`](https://pub.dev/packages/hotreloader) so file changes trigger reloads.
- Restarts the process automatically when `--bootstrap=false` (or `--no-bootstrap`).
- Accepts additional flags: `--bootstrap-path`, `--install-missing/--no-install-missing`, `--no-warn-missing`, and `--watch` for custom directories.

Use this during development; fall back to `dart run bin/server.dart` for single runs or CI pipelines.

## `routes`

```bash
dart run routed_cli routes [--format table|json] [--entry tool/spec_manifest.dart]
```

Prints the HTTP and WebSocket routes for your application. The loader tries `lib/app.dart` (expecting a `createEngine()` function) and falls back to `tool/spec_manifest.dart`, or you can point to a custom entry. Use `--format json` together with `--no-pretty` when parsing from scripts.

## `spec:generate`

```bash
dart run routed_cli spec:generate --output .dart_tool/routed/route_manifest.json
```

Writes a JSON route manifest to disk. Useful for documentation, contract tests, or code generators. Accepts the same `--entry` and `--pretty/--no-pretty` options as `routes`. The CLI ensures parent directories exist before writing.

## `openapi generate`

```bash
dart run routed_cli openapi generate [--title "My API"] [--version 1.0.0] [--server https://api.example.com]
```

Generates an OpenAPI 3.1 document from your routed engine. By default the CLI writes `.dart_tool/routed/openapi.json`; use `--output` to change the destination and `--server` (repeatable) to declare server URLs. Metadata added via `routeBuilder.openApi((op) { ... })` flows into the generated spec.

## Provider & configuration helpers

Additional commands help manage configuration manifests:

- `config:init`, `config:publish`, `config:cache`, `config:clear`
- `provider:list`, `provider:enable`, `provider:disable`

See [Configuration](/docs/routed/fundamentals/configuration) for details and usage patterns.

## Project-defined commands

Every scaffold now includes `lib/commands.dart` exposing a
`buildProjectCommands()` hook. Return one or more `Command<void>` instances and
the Routed CLI will load them automatically when you run commands from inside
the project. Project commands are listed under a "Project" section in
`dart run routed_cli --help` alongside the built-ins.

```dart title="lib/commands.dart"
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:args/command_runner.dart';

class QueueWorkCommand extends Command<void> {
  @override
  String get name => 'queue:work';

  @override
  String get description => 'Run the queue worker for the selected queue.';

  QueueWorkCommand() {
    argParser.addOption('queue', defaultsTo: 'default');
  }

  @override
  Future<void> run() async {
    final target = argResults?.option('queue') ?? 'default';
    // TODO: start worker for [target].
  }
}

FutureOr<List<Command<void>>> buildProjectCommands() => [QueueWorkCommand()];
```

If a project command reuses a built-in name (or alias) the CLI exits with a
descriptive conflict so you can pick a different identifier. Use this hook for
queue workers, seeders, diagnostic scripts, and other project automation.

## Troubleshooting

- **`dart pub get` failures:** The `create` command forwards the resolver's exit code. Fix dependency constraints, then rerun the command or execute `dart pub get` manually.
- **Hot reload not available:** The dev server installs `hotreloader` automatically when the project contains a `pubspec.yaml`. Pass `--no-install-missing` to skip installation or `--no-bootstrap` to disable the bootstrap entirely.
- **Wrong Dart SDK:** Set `ROUTED_CLI_DART` (or `DART_BIN` / `DART_PATH`) to a specific SDK path before running CLI commands.
