# Static Assets

Use the static assets provider to expose files and directories through declarative mounts backed by storage disks. Start with the configuration-driven approach in [Routing](/docs/routed/fundamentals/routing) and [Configuration](/docs/routed/fundamentals/configuration), then validate with `routed provider:list --config` and `routed routes`.
