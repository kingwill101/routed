# Route Event Hooks

`RoutingServiceProvider` emits a series of events around every request. The
example under `examples/route_events/` prints them to stdout so you can see the
order and payloads.

> Custom provider manifests? Make sure `routed.routing` remains in `config/http.yaml` so the event manager is registered. `dart run routed_cli provider:list --config` shows which providers are active when you’re trimming the manifest.

## Available events

- `BeforeRoutingEvent` – fired before route matching begins.
- `RouteMatchedEvent` – the request matched a route (includes the `EngineRoute`).
- `RouteNotFoundEvent` – nothing matched; typically results in a 404.
- `RoutingErrorEvent` – a handler threw; inspect the `error` and `stackTrace`.
- `AfterRoutingEvent` – always fired after routing (even on errors) with the
  final response status.

## Example

```dart title="examples/route_events/bin/server.dart"
import 'package:routed/routed.dart';
import 'package:routed/src/engine/events/route.dart';

Future<void> main(List<String> args) async {
  final engine = await Engine.create();

  final events = await engine.make<EventManager>();

  events.listen((BeforeRoutingEvent event) {
    print('[before] ${event.context.request.method} ${event.context.request.uri}');
  });

  events.listen((RouteMatchedEvent event) {
    print('[matched] ${event.route.name ?? '-'}');
  });

  events.listen((RouteNotFoundEvent event) {
    print('[not-found] ${event.context.request.path}');
  });

  events.listen((RoutingErrorEvent event) {
    print('[error] ${event.error}');
  });

  events.listen((AfterRoutingEvent event) {
    print('[after] status ${event.context.response.statusCode}');
  });

  engine.get('/', (ctx) => ctx.string('hello')).name('home');
  engine.get('/boom', (ctx) => throw StateError('Boom!'));

  await engine.serve(host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8081);
}
```

Run it and hit:

```
GET /        # triggers before/matched/after
GET /boom    # triggers before/matched/error/after
GET /missing # triggers before/not-found/after
```

Because these events are normal Dart streams you can attach logging,
instrumentation, tracing, or metrics collectors without modifying your handlers.
