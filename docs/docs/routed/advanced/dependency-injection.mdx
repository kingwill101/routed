# Dependency Injection

Routed ships with a lightweight dependency-injection container that powers the engine, request lifecycle, and background helpers. Factories can be async, singletons are cached, and request-scoped bindings are disposed automatically at the end of a request.

## Container fundamentals

```dart
final container = Container();

// Register a transient binding
container.bind<UuidGenerator>((c) async => UuidGenerator());

// Register a singleton
container.singleton<Database>((c) async => Database.connect());

// Store a pre-built instance
container.instance<AppConfig>(AppConfig.fromEnv());

final db = await container.make<Database>();
```

Key APIs (highlights in `packages/routed/lib/src/container/container.dart:1`):

- `bind<T>` registers a factory (transient by default).
- `singleton<T>` caches the resolved value.
- `instance<T>` stores an already-constructed object.
- `scoped<T>` registers bindings tied to the current scope (for example, a request); they’re cleared via `clearScoped()` and disposed at request end.
- `addContextualBinding`, `resolving`, and `afterResolving` let you tailor bindings per consumer type and attach hooks before/after resolution.

## Service providers

Use service providers to organize application bindings and their lifecycle (register → boot → cleanup).

```dart title="Importing built-in providers"
import 'package:routed/providers.dart';
```

```dart
class BillingServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  @override
  void register(Container container) {
    container.singleton<BillingClient>(
      (c) async => BillingClient(baseUrl: c.get<AppConfig>().billingUrl),
    );
  }

  @override
  Future<void> boot(Container container) async {
    final client = await container.make<BillingClient>();
    await client.warmup();
  }

  @override
  Future<void> cleanup(Container container) async {
    if (container.has<BillingClient>()) {
      final client = await container.make<BillingClient>();
      await client.close();
    }
  }
}
```

Attach providers to the engine via `registerProvider` (see `packages/routed/lib/src/container/container_mixin.dart:9`). Providers run in three phases:

1. `register` – executed immediately to add bindings.
2. `boot` – invoked once when the engine initialises (`Engine.initialize()`); safe to resolve other bindings.
3. `cleanup` – called for each request container and during engine shutdown.

The built-in `CoreServiceProvider` wires `EngineConfig` + `Config` via the config loader, while `RoutingServiceProvider` configures routing events (`packages/routed/lib/src/engine/providers/core.dart:1`, `packages/routed/lib/src/engine/providers/routing.dart:1`). Caching and view engines live in the `routed.cache` and `routed.views` providers. These built-ins are registered in **full mode**. Providers can also opt into `ProvidesDefaultConfig` to advertise defaults to the global `ConfigRegistry`, allowing the loader to merge them automatically. If you want to control which providers boot, pass them when constructing the engine:

```dart
final engine = await Engine.createFull(
  providers: [AnalyticsProvider()],
);

// or stay bare and only boot the providers you choose
final minimal = await Engine.create(
  providers: [AnalyticsProvider()],
);
```

## Request-scoped containers

Every request receives its own child container so you can safely store per-request state; any bindings registered as scoped are cleaned up automatically.

```dart
Future<void> handle(HttpRequest raw) async {
  final container = engine.createRequestContainer(raw, raw.response);
  try {
    final ctx = await container.make<EngineContext>();
    await myHandler(ctx);
  } finally {
    await engine.cleanupRequestContainer(container);
  }
}
```

`RequestServiceProvider` (`packages/routed/lib/src/engine/providers/request.dart:1`) registers the HTTP request/response, the `Request`/`Response` wrappers, and `EngineContext`. Any binding marked with `container.scoped()` will be disposed when the request completes.

## AppZone helpers

Code that runs outside a request can still reuse configuration, routing, and logging helpers through `AppZone` (`packages/routed/lib/src/support/zone.dart:1`).

```dart
await AppZone.run(
  engine: engine,
  body: () async {
    final url = route('notifications.show', {'id': '123'});
    final appName = configValue<String>('app.name');
    await scheduler.enqueue(url: url, app: appName);
  },
);
```

Inside an `AppZone`:

- `configValue<T>(key)` reads from the app configuration (`packages/routed/lib/src/config/helpers.dart:1`).
- `route(name, params)` generates URLs using named routes (throws if the route is unknown or parameters are missing).
- `AppZone.context` exposes an `EngineContext` when you wrap request work manually.

This is useful for background jobs, scheduled tasks, or integration tests where you still want access to the same resolved services the HTTP pipeline uses.
