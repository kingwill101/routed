# Events

Routed exposes an event bus so you can hook into the request lifecycle, provider boot, and your own domain events.

## Event manager basics

The framework registers an `EventManager` singleton via `RoutingServiceProvider` (`packages/routed/lib/src/engine/providers/routing.dart:1`). Resolve it from the container or the request context when publishing or subscribing:

```dart
final eventManager = await engine.make<EventManager>();

eventManager.on<UserSignedUp>().listen((event) {
  analytics.capture('user_signed_up', event.toJson());
});

eventManager.publish(UserSignedUp(userId: '42'));
```

Within handlers you can use the request container. For request-scoped listeners prefer one-shot operators (`.first`, `take(1)`) to avoid dangling subscriptions:

```dart
router.post('/orders', (ctx) async {
  final eventManager = await ctx.engine!.container.make<EventManager>();
  final order = await orders.create(ctx.request);
  eventManager.publish(OrderCreated(order));
  return ctx.json({'id': order.id});
});
```

`EventManager` wraps `package:event_bus/event_bus.dart` and implements `Disposable` so it cleans up on engine shutdown (`packages/routed/lib/src/events/event_manager.dart:1`). Listener lifecycle: keep references to `StreamSubscription`s and cancel them during provider `cleanup()` or test teardown to avoid leaks. For one-shot reactions prefer `.first`/`take(1)` or filter-and-`takeWhile(...)`. Always supply `onError` when listening so failures don't go unobserved.

```dart
late final StreamSubscription sub;

@override
Future<void> boot(Container c) async {
  final events = await c.make<EventManager>();
  sub = events.on<OrderCreated>().listen((e) {
    // handle event
  }, onError: (err, stack) {
    logger.error('listener failed', err, stack);
  });
}

@override
Future<void> cleanup(Container c) async {
  await sub.cancel();
}
```

## Routing lifecycle events

Routed emits structured events during request processing whenever the routing provider is active (`packages/routed/lib/src/engine/events/route.dart:1`):

- `BeforeRoutingEvent` – just after the `EngineContext` is created.
- `RouteMatchedEvent` – when a route match is found.
- `RouteNotFoundEvent` – when no route resolves the request.
- `AfterRoutingEvent` – after the handler finishes (success or error).
- `RoutingErrorEvent` – when a handler throws.

Subscribe to these events to implement logging, metrics, or tracing. Keep the returned `StreamSubscription` and cancel it during shutdown to avoid leaks:

```dart
eventManager.on<RouteMatchedEvent>().listen((event) {
  final ctx = event.context;
  log.info('[${ctx.request.method}] ${event.route.path}');
});

eventManager.on<RoutingErrorEvent>().listen((event) {
  logger.error('Route failed', event.error, event.stackTrace);
});
```

## Request signals

While the event bus remains the lowest-level primitive, Routed now exposes a higher-level signal API that mirrors Django-style lifecycle hooks. A `Signal<T>` is a thin wrapper around the `EventManager` that keeps an ordered list of handlers, executes them sequentially, and translates handler failures into structured `UnhandledSignalError` events so nothing fails silently.

```dart
import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

final hub = await engine.container.make<SignalHub>();

hub.requests.started.connect((event) {
  metrics.increment('requests_started');
});

hub.requests.routeMatched.connect((event) async {
  await tracer.attachRoute(event.context, event.route);
});

// Later, when you no longer need the handler:
hub.requests.routeMatched.disconnect(myHandler);
```

> Prefer `package:routed/signals.dart` when you only need the signal types without the full barrel import.

### Accessing the signal hub

- **Engine/container scope** – Resolve `SignalHub` from any container that can resolve `EventManager`. The routing provider registers the hub lazily, so the first `container.make<SignalHub>()` call builds it and subsequent resolutions reuse the same instance.
- **Within handlers** – `AppZone.signals` exposes the hub inside request scopes without touching the container directly:

  ```dart
  import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

  router.post('/checkout', (ctx) async {
    AppZone.signals.requests.finished.connect((event) {
      audit.logCompletion(event.context.request.id);
    });
    // ...
  });
  ```

  Disconnect temporary handlers in `finally` blocks if they outlive a single request.

- **Testing** – In integration tests resolve the hub (`await engine.container.make<SignalHub>()`) before issuing requests, attach handlers, and await their completions. Because handlers run synchronously in registration order, you can rely on deterministic sequencing when asserting side effects.

### Error handling and observability

If a handler throws, Routed publishes an `UnhandledSignalError` onto the regular event bus. Attach listeners when you want to log or fail tests on unexpected conditions:

```dart
final events = await engine.container.make<EventManager>();

events.on<UnhandledSignalError>().listen((event) {
  logger.error(
    'Signal ${event.name} failed',
    event.error,
    event.stack,
  );
});
```

Because the publish happens synchronously, the originating signal awaits the listener chain before continuing. This guarantees `handled.future` patterns in tests resolve immediately when the failure surfaces.

### Relationship to raw events

Signals are thin facades over the existing routing events—the engine still publishes `BeforeRoutingEvent`, `RouteMatchedEvent`, `AfterRoutingEvent`, and friends. Existing code listening to the raw events keeps working. Prefer signals when you want ergonomic `connect`/`disconnect` semantics, composed hubs (`hub.requests`), or discoverability for downstream packages. Prefer raw events when you need full access to `StreamSubscription` APIs (pause/resume) or when building infrastructure that should not take a dependency on the higher-level convenience layer.

## System events

The engine also publishes system-level events (`packages/routed/lib/src/events/system_events.dart:4`):

- `ProviderRegisteredEvent` / `ProviderBootedEvent` – emitted as providers register and boot.
- `RequestContainerCreatedEvent` / `RequestContainerDisposedEvent` – wrap request-scoped container lifecycle.
- `BindingRegisteredEvent` / `InstanceResolvedEvent` – detail container operations.
- `SystemErrorEvent` – covers unhandled errors surfaced by the framework.

These events are useful for diagnostics and health monitoring—log them (with sampling), increment counters, or feed them into observability pipelines.

## Configuration events

When the configuration loader finishes, Routed publishes:

- `ConfigLoadedEvent` – the initial configuration snapshot after boot.
- `ConfigReloadedEvent` – any subsequent reload (triggered by watch mode or an explicit `engine.replaceConfig(...)`).

Both events expose the resolved `Config` and optional metadata. Use them to rebuild caches or notify downstream services when configuration changes:

```dart
final events = await engine.make<EventManager>();

events.on<ConfigLoadedEvent>().listen((event) {
  logger.info("Config ready for env=${event.config.get('app.env')}");
});

events.on<ConfigReloadedEvent>().listen((event) {
  featureFlags.refresh(event.config);
  metrics.increment('config_reload_count');
});
```

## Custom events

Publishing your own events works the same way:

```dart
class InvoiceGenerated extends Event {
  InvoiceGenerated(this.invoiceId);
  final String invoiceId;
}

eventManager.publish(InvoiceGenerated('inv_2024_001'));
```

Keep event classes small and serialisable; avoid holding `EngineContext` or other heavy objects. Prefer IDs and minimal payloads so listeners stay decoupled from request state.

## View shortcuts

View handlers often fetch a model and return a 404 when it is missing. Routed's context now provides helpers that mirror Django's `get_object_or_404` pattern:

```dart
final article = await ctx.fetchOr404(() => articles.findBySlug(slug));

// `article` is guaranteed to be non-null. If the repository returns null,
// fetchOr404 logs a NotFoundError and throws it so middleware can emit a 404.
```

If you already have a value, `ctx.requireFound(value)` performs the same check synchronously:

```dart
final session = ctx.requireFound(await sessionStore.current(ctx));
```

Both helpers throw `NotFoundError` and append the error to `ctx.errors` when the value is absent, eliminating repetitive null checks in controllers.
