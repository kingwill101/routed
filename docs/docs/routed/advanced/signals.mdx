# Signals

Signals provide a lightweight publish/subscribe layer on top of Routed's event bus. They are inspired by Django's
[`django.dispatch`] signals and let packages announce that “something happened” without tightly coupling senders to
listeners. A signal owns the list of handlers, runs them in sequence, and forwards failures to the structured
`UnhandledSignalError` event so problems do not go unnoticed.

Routed exposes request lifecycle signals out of the box (`SignalHub.requests.*`), and you can create your own signals
when building reusable libraries.

## When to use signals

Prefer signals when:

- You need _hook points_ where multiple consumers can react to a lifecycle change.
- You want deterministic handler ordering (`connect` preserves registration order).
- A failing handler should produce an `UnhandledSignalError` that you can observe in tests or logs.
- You are writing a reusable package and want a narrow dependency surface (`connect` / `disconnect` instead of raw
  `StreamSubscription`s).

Prefer the event bus directly when you need `Stream` primitives such as `pause`, `resume`, or broadcast fan-out beyond
ordered handlers.

## Anatomy of a signal

`Signal<T>` is a thin adapter around the `EventManager`:

- Use `connect` to register a handler. It returns a `SignalSubscription` you can `cancel()` later.
- Provide an optional `key` (similar to Django's `dispatch_uid`) to replace previous registrations and avoid
  duplicates.
- Provide an optional `sender` to scope handlers to specific publishers.
- Signals dispatch the same event instances that the engine publishes.
- Exceptions thrown by handlers are caught, wrapped inside `UnhandledSignalError` (which now carries `key` and
  `sender` metadata), and published on the event bus.

```dart
import 'package:routed/signals.dart';

Future<void> bootMetrics(Engine engine) async {
  final hub = await engine.container.make<SignalHub>();

  final subscription = hub.requests.routeMatched.connect(
    (event) {
      metrics.increment('routes.matched', tags: {
        'route': event.route.name ?? event.route.path,
      });
    },
    key: 'metrics.route_matched',
  );

  // Engine exposes the resolved [EngineRoute] instances after routes are built.
  final dashboardRoute = engine.routes.firstWhere((route) => route.name == 'dashboard');
  hub.requests.afterRouting.connect(
    (event) {
      metrics.increment('routes.completed', tags: {'route': 'dashboard'});
    },
    sender: dashboardRoute,
    key: 'metrics.dashboard.after',
  );

  engine.onShutdown(() => subscription.cancel());
}
```

Handlers run sequentially in the order they were connected. If a handler throws, the signal continues dispatching the
remaining handlers after emitting `UnhandledSignalError`. Request signals dispatch a `RequestSignalSender` that wraps
the active `EngineContext` and optional `EngineRoute`, so you can scope handlers to the full request, a particular
route, or both.

## Built-in request signals

The routing provider wires a `SignalHub` into the container. Resolve it from any scope that can access the engine
container, or use `AppZone.signals` inside request handlers and middleware.

| Signal | Event | When it fires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hub.requests.started` | `RequestStartedEvent` | After the request context and container are initialised, before routing begins. |
| `hub.requests.routeMatched` | `RouteMatchedEvent` | As soon as the router finds a matching route. |
| `hub.requests.routingError` | `RoutingErrorEvent` | When a handler or middleware throws during request processing. |
| `hub.requests.afterRouting` | `AfterRoutingEvent` | After the middleware/handler pipeline completes (success or failure). |
| `hub.requests.finished` | `RequestFinishedEvent` | After routing completes and the engine performs its final bookkeeping. |

Inside request code you can avoid container access entirely:

```dart
import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

router.get('/checkout', (ctx) async {
  final signals = AppZone.signals;

  final cleanup = signals.requests.finished.connect(
    (event) {
      audit.log('checkout_complete', event.context.request.id);
    },
    sender: AppZone.context, // request-scoped
    key: 'audit.checkout_finished',
  );

  try {
    // ...
  } finally {
    await cleanup.cancel();
  }

  return ctx.json({'ok': true});
});
```

## Listening for failures

Attach a listener to the event bus when you want visibility into handler errors. The signal publishes immediately,
allowing tests to await the error synchronously:

```dart
final events = await engine.container.make<EventManager>();

events.on<UnhandledSignalError>().listen((event) {
  logger.error(
    'Signal ${event.name} (key=${event.key}) failed for sender ${event.sender}',
    event.error,
    event.stack,
  );
});
```

Because the publish happens synchronously, you can await futures that complete in a handler and still detect failures
without races.

## Custom signals

You can create your own signals by instantiating `Signal<T>` and calling `dispatch` manually. This is useful when
authoring packages that want to expose hooks without leaking their internal event classes.

```dart
final class MailSent extends Event {
  MailSent(this.messageId);
  final String messageId;
}

final Signal<MailSent> mailSent = Signal<MailSent>(
  name: 'example.mail.sent',
  manager: eventManager,
);

Future<void> deliverMail(String to, String body) async {
  final id = await provider.send(to: to, body: body);
  await mailSent.dispatch(
    MailSent(id),
    sender: provider,
  );
}
```

Choose descriptive signal names (`vendor.domain.action`) so downstream packages can filter them. If you publish signals
from a service provider, register them in `boot` and clean up the handlers in `cleanup`. When targeting the built-in
request signals you can also scope to a specific route by registering with `sender: engine.findRoute('dashboard')` (the
same `EngineRoute` instance the router uses).

## Guidelines and best practices

- **Connect early, disconnect reliably** – retain the function passed to `connect` if you plan to disconnect later. For
  short-lived handlers wrap them in `try/finally`, or rely on the returned `SignalSubscription`.
- **Use keys to prevent duplicates** – supply a `key` whenever you register a global handler so repeated bootstraps
  overwrite the previous handler instead of appending duplicates.
- **Scope to senders when possible** – filtering by sender keeps handlers tightly focused and reduces unexpected side
  effects. Handlers can provide an `EngineContext`, an `EngineRoute`, or a custom object when connecting.
- **Document payload shape** – signals reuse event classes; link to their definitions so consumers know available
  context.
- **Avoid side effects in error listeners** – `UnhandledSignalError` handlers should log or emit metrics. Do not throw
  unless you intend to crash the process.
- **Unit test signal flows** – Integration tests can attach handlers to `SignalHub` and assert order or error handling,
  as seen in `packages/routed/test/events/signal_test.dart`.
