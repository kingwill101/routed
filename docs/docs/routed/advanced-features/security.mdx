## Proxy Trust and Client IP Resolution

Routed provides secure-by-default proxy handling with explicit opt-in required for trusting proxies or CDN platforms.

### Default Behavior

By default, Routed does not trust any proxies and will return the direct client IP. This is the safest approach for applications not using proxies or CDNs.

### Enabling Proxy Support

To trust specific proxies:

```dart
final engine = Engine(
  config: EngineConfig(
    features: EngineFeatures(enableProxySupport: true),
    trustedProxies: ['192.168.1.2', '10.0.0.0/8']
  )
);
```

When proxy support is enabled:

- Only listed IP addresses and CIDR ranges are trusted
- X-Forwarded-For headers are only processed from trusted proxies
- Client IP resolution follows the proxy chain correctly

### CDN and Platform Trust
For applications behind CDNs, Routed provides predefined trusted platform headers:

```dart
final engine = Engine(
  config: EngineConfig(
    features: EngineFeatures(enableTrustedPlatform: true),
    trustedPlatform: EngineConfig.platformCloudflare
  )
);
```

Available platform constants:

`platformCloudflare`: Uses CF-Connecting-IP header
`platformGoogleAppEngine`: Uses X-Appengine-Remote-Addr header
`platformFlyIO`: Uses Fly-Client-IP header

You can also specify custom headers:
```
trustedPlatform: 'X-Custom-Client-IP'
```

### Feature Priority

- If trusted platform is enabled, its header takes precedence
- If only proxy support is enabled, trusted proxy rules apply
- If neither is enabled, direct client IP is used

### Security Considerations
- Never trust all proxies by default
- Only enable proxy support if you use reverse proxies
- Validate CDN headers are not user-controllable
- Use CIDR ranges carefully to limit trust scope
- Monitor logs for IP spoofing attempts


### Best Practices
1. Minimal Trust Configuration:
```dart
// Trust single proxy
engine.config.trustedProxies = ['10.0.0.1'];
```

2. CDN Configuration:
```
// Using Cloudflare
engine.config.trustedPlatform = EngineConfig.platformCloudflare;
```

3. Development Setup:
```
// Local development with proxy
if (isDevelopment) {
  engine.config.trustedProxies = ['127.0.0.1'];
}
```

### Client IP Resolution

The `Context.clientIP()` method follows this resolution order:

- Trusted platform header if enabled
- X-Forwarded-For from trusted proxies if enabled
- Direct remote IP address


### Example Configurations

1. Basic Proxy Setup:

```dart
engine.config = EngineConfig(
    features: EngineFeatures(enableProxySupport: true),
    trustedProxies: ['192.168.1.2']
);
```

2. CDN Configuration:

```dart
    engine.config = EngineConfig(
    features: EngineFeatures(enableTrustedPlatform: true),
    trustedPlatform: EngineConfig.platformCloudflare
    );
```

3. Mixed Environment:
    ```dart
    engine.config = EngineConfig(
    features: EngineFeatures(
        enableProxySupport: true,
        enableTrustedPlatform: true
    ),
    trustedProxies: ['10.0.0.0/8'],
    trustedPlatform: EngineConfig.platformCloudflare
    );
```
