# Observability

The observability provider publishes health, readiness, and metrics endpoints, and wires tracing/metrics middleware into the request pipeline.

## Configuration

```yaml title="config/observability.yaml"
observability:
  enabled: true
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    service_name: routed-api
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    route: /metrics
  health:
    enabled: true
    ready_route: /readyz
    live_route: /livez
```

## Routes & metrics

- `/metrics` exposes Prometheus metrics (`routed_requests_total`, `routed_request_duration_seconds_*`, `routed_active_requests`).
- `/readyz` and `/livez` are health probes for orchestration.

## Behavior

- Middleware IDs: `routed.observability.tracing` and `routed.observability.metrics`.
- Use `routed routes` to confirm endpoints are registered.
