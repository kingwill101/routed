title:  Developing a RESTful API with Routed
description: Learn how to develop a RESTful API with Routed
---


This tutorial introduces the basics of writing a RESTful web service API with Routed.

You’ll get the most out of this tutorial if you have a basic familiarity with Dart and its tooling.

Routed simplifies many coding tasks associated with building web applications, including web services. In this tutorial, you’ll use Routed to route requests, retrieve request details, and marshal JSON for responses.

In this tutorial, you will build a RESTful API server with two endpoints. Your example project will be a repository of data about vintage jazz records.

The tutorial includes the following sections:

- Design API endpoints.
- Create a folder for your code.
- Create the data.
- Write a handler to return all items.
- Write a handler to add a new item.
- Write a handler to return a specific item.

## Prerequisites

- **An installation of Dart SDK 3.0 or later.** For installation instructions, see [Dart SDK Installation](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
- **A tool to edit your code.** Any text editor you have will work fine. VSCode is recommended.
- **A command terminal.** Dart works well using any terminal on Linux and Mac, and on PowerShell or cmd in Windows.
- **The curl tool.**  This will be used to test the API.

## Design API endpoints

You’ll build an API that provides access to a store selling vintage recordings on vinyl. So you’ll need to provide endpoints through which a client can get and add albums for users.

When developing an API, you typically begin by designing the endpoints. Your API’s users will have more success if the endpoints are easy to understand.

Here are the endpoints you’ll create in this tutorial.

/albums

-   `GET` – Get a list of all albums, returned as JSON.
-   `POST` – Add a new album from request data sent as JSON.

/albums/:id

-   `GET` – Get an album by its ID, returning the album data as JSON.

Next, you’ll create a folder for your code.

## Create a folder for your code

To begin, create a project for the code you’ll write.

1.  Open a command prompt and change to your home directory.

    On Linux or Mac:

    ```bash
    $ cd
    ```

    On Windows:

    ```cmd
    C:\> cd %HOMEPATH%
    ```

2.  Using the command prompt, create a directory for your code called `web-service-routed`.

    ```bash
    $ mkdir web-service-routed
    $ cd web-service-routed
    ```

3.  Create a Dart project using the `dart create` command.

    ```bash
    $ dart create .
    ```

    Choose the `console` application template. This will create a basic Dart project structure.

4.  Add `routed` and `http` as dependencies

    Edit the `pubspec.yaml` file.  Add `routed` and `http` to the dependencies section:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      routed: ^1.0.0 # Replace with the current version
      http: ^1.0.0
    ```

    Run `dart pub get` to fetch the dependencies.

Next, you’ll design data structures for handling data.

## Create the data

To keep things simple for the tutorial, you’ll store data in memory. A more typical API would interact with a database.

Note that storing data in memory means that the set of albums will be lost each time you stop the server, then recreated when you start it.

### Write the code

1.  Delete the `bin/web_service_routed.dart` that was generated.
2.  Using your text editor, create a file called `bin/server.dart` in the `web-service-routed` directory. You’ll write your Dart code in this file.
3.  Into `bin/server.dart`, at the top of the file, paste the following code.

    ```dart
    import 'dart:convert';
    import 'dart:io';

    import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

    void main() async {
      final engine = Engine();

      // Route handler will go here

      await engine.serve(host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080);
    }

    /// The framework will automatically decode the body and deserialize it.
    /// You must use the [ctx.bind()] helper and define the associated data model.
    ```

    This imports the necessary packages and sets up the `main` function, which is the entry point of the Dart application.

4.  Beneath the `main` function, paste the following declaration of an `Album` class. You’ll use this to store album data in memory.

    ```dart
    class Album {
      String id;
      String title;
      String artist;
      double price;

      Album({
        required this.id,
        required this.title,
        required this.artist,
        required this.price,
      });

      factory Album.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
        return Album(
          id: json['id'],
          title: json['title'],
          artist: json['artist'],
          price: json['price'].toDouble(),
        );
      }

      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
            'id': id,
            'title': title,
            'artist': artist,
            'price': price,
          };
    }
    factory Album.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
      return Album(
        id: json['id'],
        title: json['title'],
        artist: json['artist'],
        price: json['price'].toDouble(),
      );
    }

    Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
          'id': id,
          'title': title,
          'artist': artist,
          'price': price,
        };
  }

  /// The album class is a data model to handle the data,
  /// it contains a `toJson` method to serialize to json and `fromJson`
  /// used for constructing the object
    ```

5.  Beneath the class declaration you just added, paste the following list of `Album` objects containing data you’ll use to start.

    ```dart
    final List<Album> albums = [
      Album(id: '1', title: 'Blue Train', artist: 'John Coltrane', price: 56.99),
      Album(id: '2', title: 'Jeru', artist: 'Gerry Mulligan', price: 17.99),
      Album(id: '3', title: 'Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown', artist: 'Sarah Vaughan', price: 39.99),
    ];
    ```

Next, you’ll write code to implement your first endpoint.

## Write a handler to return all items

When the client makes a request at `GET /albums`, you want to return all the albums as JSON.

To do this, you’ll write the following:

- Logic to prepare a response
- Code to map the request path to your logic

Note that this is the reverse of how they’ll be executed at runtime, but you’re adding dependencies first, then the code that depends on them.

### Write the code

1.  Add the handler to send the album list as JSON.

    Inside the `main` function, above the `await engine.serve` call, paste the following code:

    ```dart
    engine.get('/albums', (Context ctx) {
      final json = albums.map((a) => a.toJson()).toList();
      return ctx.json(json);
    });
    ```

    In this code, you:

    - Use `engine.get` to register a route that handles `GET` requests to the `/albums` endpoint.
    - Use `ctx.json` to serialize the `albums` list into JSON format and send it as the response.

2.  Start the server

    Your `main` function should now look like this:
    ```dart
    import 'dart:convert';
    import 'dart:io';

    import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

    class Album {
      final String id;
      final String title;
      final String artist;
      final double price;

      Album({
        required this.id,
        required this.title,
        required this.artist,
        required this.price,
      });

      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
            'id': id,
            'title': title,
            'artist': artist,
            'price': price,
          };
    }

    final List<Album> albums = [
      Album(id: '1', title: 'Blue Train', artist: 'John Coltrane', price: 56.99),
      Album(id: '2', title: 'Jeru', artist: 'Gerry Mulligan', price: 17.99),
      Album(id: '3', title: 'Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown', artist: 'Sarah Vaughan', price: 39.99),
    ];


    void main() async {
      final engine = Engine();

      engine.get('/albums', (Context ctx) {
        final json = albums.map((a) => a.toJson()).toList();
        return ctx.json(json);
      });

      await engine.serve(host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080);
    }
    ```
    Run the server

    ```bash
    dart run bin/server.dart
    ```

3.   From a new command line window, use `curl` to make a request to your running web service.

    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/albums
    ```

    The command should display the data you seeded the service with.

    ```json
    [
      {"id":"1","title":"Blue Train","artist":"John Coltrane","price":56.99},
      {"id":"2","title":"Jeru","artist":"Gerry Mulligan","price":17.99},
      {"id":"3","title":"Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown","artist":"Sarah Vaughan","price":39.99}
    ]
    ```

You’ve started an API! In the next section, you’ll create another endpoint with code to handle a `POST` request to add an item.

## Write a handler to add a new item

When the client makes a `POST` request at `/albums`, you want to add the album described in the request body to the existing albums’ data.

To do this, you’ll write the following:

- Logic to add the new album to the existing list.
- A bit of code to route the `POST` request to your logic.

### Write the code

1.  Add code to add albums data to the list of albums.

    Before the `await engine.serve` line, paste the following code.

    ```dart
     engine.post('/albums', (Context ctx) async {
        final body = await ctx.request.body();
        final decoded = jsonDecode(body);

        final album = Album(
          id: decoded['id'],
          title: decoded['title'],
          artist: decoded['artist'],
          price: decoded['price'].toDouble(),
        );

        albums.add(album);

        return ctx.json(album.toJson(), statusCode: HttpStatus.created);
      });
    ```

    In this code, you:

    - Use `ctx.request.body()` to read the request body.
    - Decode the JSON from the request body into a map.
    - Create a new `Album` object using the data from the map.
    - Add the new `Album` to the `albums` list.
    - Return a 201 Created status code with the JSON representation of the new album.

2. The `main` function should now look like this:
    ```dart
    import 'dart:convert';
    import 'dart:io';

    import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

    class Album {
      final String id;
      final String title;
      final String artist;
      final double price;

      Album({
        required this.id,
        required this.title,
        required this.artist,
        required this.price,
      });

      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
            'id': id,
            'title': title,
            'artist': artist,
            'price': price,
          };
    }

    final List<Album> albums = [
      Album(id: '1', title: 'Blue Train', artist: 'John Coltrane', price: 56.99),
      Album(id: '2', title: 'Jeru', artist: 'Gerry Mulligan', price: 17.99),
      Album(id: '3', title: 'Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown', artist: 'Sarah Vaughan', price: 39.99),
    ];


    void main() async {
      final engine = Engine();

      engine.get('/albums', (Context ctx) {
        final json = albums.map((a) => a.toJson()).toList();
        return ctx.json(json);
      });

        engine.post('/albums', (Context ctx) async {
          final album = Album(
            id: '',
            title: '',
            artist: '',
            price: 0.0,
          );

          await ctx.bind(album);

          albums.add(album);

          return ctx.json(album.toJson(), statusCode: HttpStatus.created);
        });

      await engine.serve(host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080);
    }
    ```
3. If the server is still running from the last section, stop it.
4. From the command line in the directory containing `bin/server.dart`, run the code.

   ```bash
   $ dart run bin/server.dart
   ```
5. From a different command line window, use `curl` to make a request to your running web service.

   ```bash
   $ curl http://localhost:8080/albums \
       --include \
       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --request "POST" \
       --data '{"id": "4","title": "The Modern Sound of Betty Carter","artist": "Betty Carter","price": 49.99}'
   ```

   The command should display headers and JSON for the added album.

   ```json
   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   content-type: application/json
   transfer-encoding: chunked
   date: Sat, 22 Jun 2024 22:36:17 GMT

   {"id":"4","title":"The Modern Sound of Betty Carter","artist":"Betty Carter","price":49.99}
   ```

6.  As in the previous section, use `curl` to retrieve the full list of albums, which you can use to confirm that the new album was added.

    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/albums
        --header "Content-Type: application/json"
        --request "GET"
    ```

    The command should display the album list.

    ```json
    [
      {"id":"1","title":"Blue Train","artist":"John Coltrane","price":56.99},
      {"id":"2","title":"Jeru","artist":"Gerry Mulligan","price":17.99},
      {"id":"3","title":"Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown","artist":"Sarah Vaughan","price":39.99},
      {"id":"4","title":"The Modern Sound of Betty Carter","artist":"Betty Carter","price":49.99}
    ]
    ```

In the next section, you’ll add code to handle a `GET` for a specific item.

## Write a handler to return a specific item

When the client makes a request to `GET /albums/[id]`, you want to return the album whose ID matches the `id` path parameter.

To do this, you will:

- Add logic to retrieve the requested album.
- Map the path to the logic.

### Write the code

1.  Add code to retrieve a specific album.

    Inside the `main` function and above the `await engine.serve` line, paste the following code:

    ```dart
     engine.get('/albums/{id}', (Context ctx) {
        final id = ctx.param('id');

        try {
          final album = albums.firstWhere((album) => album.id == id);
          return ctx.json(album.toJson());
        } catch (e) {
          return ctx.string('Album not found', statusCode: HttpStatus.notFound);
        }
      });
    ```

    In this code, you:

    - Use `ctx.param('id')` to retrieve the `id` path parameter from the URL.
    - Use `albums.firstWhere` to find the album with a matching ID.
    - Use `ctx.json` to return the found album as a JSON response.
    - Use `HttpStatus.notFound` to return a `404 Not Found` status code if no album with the given ID is found.

2.  The full `main` function should look like this:

    ```dart
    import 'dart:convert';
    import 'dart:io';

    import 'package:routed/routed.dart';

    class Album {
      final String id;
      final String title;
      final String artist;
      final double price;

      Album({
        required this.id,
        required this.title,
        required this.artist,
        required this.price,
      });

      Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
            'id': id,
            'title': title,
            'artist': artist,
            'price': price,
          };
    }

    final List<Album> albums = [
      Album(id: '1', title: 'Blue Train', artist: 'John Coltrane', price: 56.99),
      Album(id: '2', title: 'Jeru', artist: 'Gerry Mulligan', price: 17.99),
      Album(id: '3', title: 'Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown', artist: 'Sarah Vaughan', price: 39.99),
    ];


    void main() async {
      final engine = Engine();

      engine.get('/albums', (Context ctx) {
        final json = albums.map((a) => a.toJson()).toList();
        return ctx.json(json);
      });

      engine.post('/albums', (Context ctx) async {
        final body = await ctx.request.body();
        final decoded = jsonDecode(body);

        final album = Album(
          id: decoded['id'],
          title: decoded['title'],
          artist: decoded['artist'],
          price: decoded['price'].toDouble(),
        );

        albums.add(album);

        return ctx.json(album.toJson(), statusCode: HttpStatus.created);
      });

       engine.get('/albums/{id}', (Context ctx) {
        final id = ctx.param('id');

        final album = albums.firstWhere((album) => album.id == id, orElse: () => throw NotFoundError());
        return ctx.json(album.toJson());
      });

      await engine.serve(host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080);
    }
    ```

3.  If the server is still running from the last section, stop it.
4.  From the command line in the directory containing `bin/server.dart`, run the code to start the server.

    ```bash
    $ dart run bin/server.dart
    ```

5.  From a different command line window, use `curl` to make a request to your running web service.

    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/albums/2
    ```

    The command should display JSON for the album whose ID you used. If the album wasn’t found, you’ll get JSON with an error message.

    ```json
    {"id":"2","title":"Jeru","artist":"Gerry Mulligan","price":17.99}
    ```
