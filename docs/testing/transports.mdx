# Test Transports

Routed provides two transport mechanisms for testing: InMemory and EphemeralServer.

## InMemory Transport

Default transport that simulates HTTP requests without actual network connections. While this mode is sufficient for most test cases, it has some limitations since it mocks HTTP behavior:

### What Works
- Route matching
- Request/response body handling
- Basic headers
- JSON content
- Form data
- File uploads (in memory)
- Session handling
- Cookie basics
- Status codes
- Response types (JSON, HTML, etc)

### Limitations
- Some complex header behaviors
- Certain network-specific features
- Real TCP/IP behaviors
- Some cookie attributes
- Some HTTP/2 features
- WebSocket testing
- Some SSL/TLS features

For these cases, use the EphemeralServer transport.

```dart
// Implicitly using InMemory transport
final client = EngineTestClient(engine);

// Or explicitly
final client = EngineTestClient.inMemory(engine);
```

### Advantages
- Faster execution
- No network overhead
- No port conflicts
- Suitable for most tests

### Limitations
- Cannot test actual HTTP behavior
- Some headers may not be perfectly simulated
- Network-specific issues can't be tested
- State can leak between test cases in the same process

### State Isolation Warning

When using InMemory transport, internal state may leak between test cases due to shared memory and implementation details. To ensure test isolation:

```dart
// RECOMMENDED: Create new engine and client for each test
void main() {
  group('API Tests', () {
    test('test 1', () async {
      final engine = Engine();
      final client = EngineTestClient(engine);
      // Test implementation...
      await client.close();
    });

    test('test 2', () async {
      final engine = Engine();
      final client = EngineTestClient(engine);
      // Test implementation...
      await client.close();
    });
  });
}

// NOT RECOMMENDED: State may leak between tests
void main() {
  late Engine engine;
  late EngineTestClient client;

  setUp(() {
    engine = Engine();
    client = EngineTestClient(engine);
  });

  test('test 1', () async {
    // May be affected by state from previous tests
    await client.postJson('/cache', {'key': 'value'});
  });

  test('test 2', () async {
    // Cache from test 1 might still exist
    final response = await client.getJson('/cache');
  });
}
```

For guaranteed isolation, use `TransportMode.ephemeralServer`:

```dart
// Each request gets a fresh server instance
final client = EngineTestClient(
  engine,
  TransportMode.ephemeralServer
);
```
- Potential state leakage between test cases

### Important: State Isolation

The InMemory transport can sometimes leak state between test cases due to implementation details. To avoid this:

```dart
// GOOD: Isolate each test with its own engine and client
void main() {
  group('API Tests', () {
    test('test 1', () async {
      final engine = Engine();
      final client = EngineTestClient(engine);
      // Test implementation...
    });
    
    test('test 2', () async {
      final engine = Engine();
      final client = EngineTestClient(engine);
      // Test implementation...
    });
  });
}

// BAD: Shared engine/client may leak state
void main() {
  late Engine engine;
  late EngineTestClient client;
  
  setUp(() {
    engine = Engine();
    client = EngineTestClient(engine);
  });
  
  test('test 1', () async {
    // May be affected by state from other tests
  });
  
  test('test 2', () async {
    // May be affected by state from other tests
  });
}
```

Alternatively, use the EphemeralServer transport which provides better state isolation by default since it creates a fresh server instance for each request:

```dart
final client = EngineTestClient(
  engine,
  TransportMode.ephemeralServer
);
```

## Ephemeral Server Transport

Creates a real HTTP server for each test:

```dart
final client = EngineTestClient.ephemeralServer(engine);
```

### Advantages
- Tests real HTTP behavior
- Network headers work exactly as in production
- Can test network-related features
- More accurate simulation

### Limitations
- Slower than InMemory
- Requires port management
- More resource intensive

## Choosing a Transport

```dart
// Default for most tests
final client = EngineTestClient(engine);

// When testing HTTP-specific behavior
final client = EngineTestClient(
  engine,
  TransportMode.ephemeralServer
);

// When testing complex headers/cookies
final client = EngineTestClient(
  engine,
  TransportMode.ephemeralServer
);
```

## Transport Lifecycle

```dart
void main() {
  late EngineTestClient client;

  setUp(() {
    client = EngineTestClient(engine);
  });

  tearDown(() async {
    await client.close();  // Important for EphemeralServer
  });
  
  test('example test', () async {
    final response = await client.get('/test');
    response.assertStatus(200);
  });
}
```
