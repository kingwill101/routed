# jaspr_routed example

This example mirrors the Jaspr Serverpod demo, but swaps Serverpod for the Routed backend.

## Run locally

```bash
cd packages/jaspr_routed/example
dart pub get
# Generates the `lib/jaspr_options.dart` mapping plus the client bundle used
# for hydrating @client components.
jaspr build clients
dart run bin/server.dart
```

Visit <http://127.0.0.1:9000> and the counter widget will hydrate on the client.

## Notes

- `jaspr build clients` must be re-run whenever you change client components (e.g. `Counter`).
- `lib/jaspr_options.dart` is generated by `jaspr_builder`; re-run `jaspr build clients` whenever you add/remove @client
  components to refresh it.
- `jasprRoute` handles the client bundle internally, so no extra static-file wiring is needed.
