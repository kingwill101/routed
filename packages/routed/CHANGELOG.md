## Unreleased

- Unified driver registration across storage, cache, and session providers so built-in drivers register through the same
  public APIs that applications use.
- Added a storage driver registry and disk builders, enabling custom storage drivers without editing the service
  provider.
- Driver registries now accept documentation callbacks so storage/cache/session drivers can advertise their custom
  configuration keys in provider docs.
- `routed provider:driver` scaffolds starter files for storage and cache drivers, including documentation hooks that
  surface in `provider:list --config`.
- Added `logging.include_stack_traces` to control whether unhandled errors log stack traces; defaults to `false` for
  quieter production logs while keeping browser responses unchanged.
- `ctx.sse` now disables output buffering, primes the response with a `:ok` comment, flushes every frame immediately,
  and watches the shutdown controller so draining servers close SSE connections promptly.
- The HTTP accept loop processes each request concurrently, so long-lived SSE streams no longer block unrelated
  requests.
- `Response.flush()` now flushes the very first bytes even before streaming beginsâ€”SSE clients advance to the OPEN state
  instantly.
- Added `EngineContext.upgrade`, a safe alternative to socket hijacking for bespoke protocols that need direct access to
  the underlying `Socket`.
- Replaced SSE integration tests with lightweight context tests that cover event encoding, heartbeats, and error paths.
- Documented Server-Sent Events usage and added a runnable counter example, linking both into the docs navigation.

## 0.1.0

- Introduced a contextual logging API (`ctx.logger`/`LoggingContext`) and exposed configuration hooks via
  `RoutedLogger`.
- Added configurable error handling hooks (`beforeError`, `onError`, `afterError`) plus default observers for request
  failures.
- Unified middleware and handler signatures to return `Response`, ensuring predictable flow control across the pipeline.
- Refreshed binding and validation utilities with overridable rule factories and per-field message overrides.
- Tightened engine lifecycle management with request-scoped containers, request tracking, and safer size limiting.
- Updated dependencies (`contextual`, `liquify`, `decimal`, `lints`, `server_testing`), removed the unused TOML
  renderer, and bumped the SDK minimum to 3.9.0.

## 0.0.1-alpha

- Initial version.
