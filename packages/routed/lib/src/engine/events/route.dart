/// Event fired before route matching begins.
///
/// This event is emitted when a request arrives but before the engine attempts
/// to match it to any registered routes. Listeners can use this to log incoming
/// requests, modify the request context, or perform pre-routing validation.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// eventManager.listen<BeforeRoutingEvent>((event) {
///   final path = event.context.request.uri.path;
///   print('Incoming request: ${event.context.request.method} $path');
/// });
/// ```

/// Event fired when a route is successfully matched.
///
/// This event is emitted after a route has been matched to the request but
/// before the route's handler is executed. Listeners can use this to log
/// matched routes, perform route-specific setup, or modify the context before
/// handler execution.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// eventManager.listen<RouteMatchedEvent>((event) {
///   final routeName = event.route.name ?? 'unnamed';
///   print('Matched route: $routeName (${event.route.path})');
///
///   // Add route information to context
///   event.context.set('route_name', routeName);
/// });
/// ```

///
/// This event is emitted when a request cannot be matched to any registered
/// route, including fallback routes. Listeners can use this for custom 404
/// handling, logging unmatched requests, or implementing dynamic routing.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// eventManager.listen<RouteNotFoundEvent>((event) {
///   final path = event.context.request.uri.path;
///   final method = event.context.request.method;
///   print('404: $method $path not found');

///   // Track 404s in analytics
///   analytics.trackNotFound(path);
/// });
/// ```

/// Event fired after a route handler has completed.
///
/// This event is emitted after the route handler has finished executing,
/// regardless of whether it completed successfully or threw an error.
/// Listeners can use this for logging, cleanup, performance tracking,
/// or response modification.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// eventManager.listen<AfterRoutingEvent>((event) {
///   final duration = DateTime.now().difference(event.context.get('start_time'));
///   final status = event.context.response.statusCode;
///
///   print('Request completed in ${duration.inMilliseconds}ms (status: $status)');
///
///   if (event.error != null) {
///     print('Error occurred: ${event.error}');
///   }
/// });
/// ```

/// Event fired when a route handler throws an error.
///
/// This event is emitted when an error occurs during route handler execution,
/// including errors in middleware. Listeners can use this for centralized
/// error logging, reporting, or custom error responses.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// eventManager.listen<RoutingErrorEvent>((event) {
///   final error = event.error;
///   final path = event.context.request.uri.path;
///
///   // Log the error with context
///   logger.error('Error handling $path: $error', event.stackTrace);
