## 0.1.0

- `create` adds `api`, `web`, and `fullstack` templates with tailored scaffolds.
- Routed CLI now loads project-defined commands from `lib/commands.dart`, exposing them alongside the built-ins and
  guarding against name collisions.
- `provider:list --config` now fails early when duplicate driver registrations are detected and prints guidance for
  resolving the conflicting IDs.

## 0.0.1

- Initial version.
