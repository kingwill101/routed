Reference blog application that demonstrates `class_view` in practice. It is not
published to pub.dev—the code lives in this repo so you can explore widgets,
form templates, and routing strategies end-to-end.

## What it shows

- Liquid templates powered by `class_view` view contexts.
- CRUD flows with form validation and error rendering.
- Routing integration examples for Routed + Shelf adapters.

Run it with:

```bash
dart run bin/server.dart
```

## Funding
